The Project "7 MW Clean Energy Project by Gro Solar" is a solar-based power generation facility, it is
a grid connected solar power project located in District - Dhule in Maharashtra state of India. It has been
operational since 24/06/2021, which is the earliest commissioning date. The project is owned by Gro
Solar Energy Pvt. Ltd (hereinafter referred to as the Project Proponent or PP).

The purpose of the proposed project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable source
of energy i.e., solar radiation. The project activity replaces anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases
(GHG’s) into the atmosphere, by displacing the equivalent amount of electricity generation through the
operation of existing fuel fossil fuel- based power plants and future capacity expansions connected to the
grid. In the absence of the project activity the equivalent amount of electricity would have been generated
from the fossil fuel-based power plant. Whereas the electricity generation from the operation of
Photovoltaic stations is emission free. 

Commissioning dates of the Solar plant is shown below :

Ground type Free field with 2-3 meter undulations are Observed

The project will generate approximately 153,300 MWh of electricity per annum. The project activity
has been helping in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable resources (solar
energy) for generating power which otherwise would have been generated using grid mix power plants,
which is dominated by fossil fuel based thermal power plants. The estimated annual average and the
total CO2e emission reduction by the project activity is expected to be 11,147 t/CO2e & 122,619 t/CO2e
respectively, whereas actual emission reduction achieved during the first CoU period shall be submitted
as a part of first monitoring and verification.
